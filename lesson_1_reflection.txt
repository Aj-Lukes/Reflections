How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It scans and skims for you, especially helpful that it can spot look alike characters.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    So you don't make same changes, back and forth, or make bugged changes repeatedly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual is more meaningful, but also is more prone to error (forgetfulness).

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git sees the relationships between files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log reads your manually entered commit descriptions, then git diff show differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because your HEAD can always be detached!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
